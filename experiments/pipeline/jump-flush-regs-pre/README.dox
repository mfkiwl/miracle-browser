@brief Do jump instructions clear pipeline registers?

## Purpose:

Do jumpes flush the contents of pipeline registers?

## Expectations:

- There should be no hamming weight leakage in any case.
- If there is overwrite between the two TTest variables, this
  will manifest as detectable hamming distance leakage.

## Running the experiment

To run all stages of the experiment for a particular target device:

```
make -B USB_PORT=[PORT] UAS_TARGET=[TARGET] flow-pipeline-jump-flush-regs
```

Where:
- `[PORT]` Is the UART/Serial port to communicate with it over.
- `[TARGET]` Is one of the target names listed in @ref targets

This will run all of the build, program, capture and analyse steps for
the experiment on the specified target.

The individual steps of the experiment are run with the following commands:

- Build: `make build_[TARGET]_pipeline-jump-flush-regs-pre`
- Program: `make program_[TARGET]_pipeline-jump-flush-regs-pre`
- Capture: `make capture_[TARGET]_pipeline-jump-flush-regs-pre USB_PORT=[PORT]`
- Analyse: `make analyse_[TARGET]_pipeline-jump-flush-regs-pre`
