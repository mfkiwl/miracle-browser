## 5. Logic gating

Logic gating (wrt. clock gating) is a technique used to reduce
toggling (and so energy consumption) in digital logic circuits.
- If I have an an ALU with two functions, ADD or XOR, then I don't
  want the adder to toggle needlessly (and leak) when using the XOR
  function.
- I then bitwise AND the inputs to the adder (*higher up*) in the circuit
  with the `add_select` bit. This zeros the inputs the adder, preventing
  downstream toggling from glitches.

Questions:
1. How does logic gating effect leakage?
2. If how logic gating changes the leakage is understood, can we exploit
   this?

Hypothesis 1: The "noise" generated by un-used computations will reduce
leakage.

Hypothesis 2: The extra toggling will cause *more* leakage, if that toggling
can be modelled.
