@defgroup experiments-memory-bus-width-words Memory Bus Width - Words 
@ingroup  experiments-memory
@brief Just how much data do we get when loading a word?

## Background

This experiment is a repeat of @ref experiments-memory-bus-width-bytes
but using word load operations rather than byte loads.

## Running the experiment

To run all stages of the experiment for a particular target device:

```
make -B USB_PORT=[PORT] UAS_TARGET=[TARGET] flow-memory-bus-bus-width-word
```

Where:
- `[PORT]` Is the UART/Serial port to communicate with it over.
- `[TARGET]` Is one of the target names listed in @ref targets

This will run all of the build, program, capture and analyse steps for
the experiment on the specified target.

The individual steps of the experiment are run with the following commands:

- Build: `make build_[TARGET]_memory-bus-width-word`
- Program: `make program_[TARGET]_memory-bus-width-word`
- Capture: `make capture_[TARGET]_memory-bus-width-word USB_PORT=[PORT]`
- Analyse: `make program_[TARGET]_memory-bus-width-word`
