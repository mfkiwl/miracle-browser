@brief Do we accidentally do a load to undocumented registers on a store?

@see @ref experiments-memory-registers-ld-byte
@see @ref experiments-memory-registers-st-byte
@see @ref experiments-memory-registers-implicit-st-ld
@see @ref experiments-memory-registers-implicit-ld-st

@note This experiment is identical to 
@ref experiments-memory-registers-implicit-st-ld but it does a store then a load, rather than load then store.

## Purpose:

To discover if the RAMS on the target device implicitly load memory
data into a register when it is over-written by a store.

## Method:

@todo registers-implicit-ld-st method.

## Expectations:


## Findings

@todo Re-write registers-implicit-ld-st experiment findings with new results.

## Running the experiment

To run all stages of the experiment for a particular target device:

```
make -B USB_PORT=[PORT] UAS_TARGET=[TARGET] flow-memory-bus-registers-implicit-ld-st
```

Where:
- `[PORT]` Is the UART/Serial port to communicate with it over.
- `[TARGET]` Is one of the target names listed in @ref targets

This will run all of the build, program, capture and analyse steps for
the experiment on the specified target.

The individual steps of the experiment are run with the following commands:

- Build: `make build_[TARGET]_memory-bus-registers-implicit-ld-st`
- Program: `make program_[TARGET]_memory-bus-registers-implicit-ld-st`
- Capture: `make capture_[TARGET]_memory-bus-registers-implicit-ld-st USB_PORT=[PORT]`
- Analyse: `make program_[TARGET]_memory-bus-registers-implicit-ld-st`
