@defgroup experiments-memory-bus-width-hw Memory Bus Width - halfwords
@brief A variant of the bus-width experiment using halfwords.
@ingroup  experiments-memory

@tableofcontents

@todo Re-write and re-document this experiment.


## Purpose:

- To work out how wide the data bus of a SoC is.
- To identify if, given a load byte instruction, multiple bytes are in
  fact loaded.
- **Note:** This is a repeat of the bus-width experiment, but using halfwords
  rather than bytes.
