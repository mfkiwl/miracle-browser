@brief Is there implicit leakage on a store-after-store?

This acts as an analogue to the
@ref experiments-memory-registers-implicit-ld-ld
experiment, but does a sequence of two stores, rather than two loads.

It also acts as an analogue to the
@ref experiments-memory-registers-implicit-st-st-1
experiment.
This experiment stores the TTest variables from CPU registers to memory,
overwriting zeros in the memory.
The other experiment stores zeros, overwriting the TTest variables in
memory.

## Purpose:

To discover if, when overwriting memory locations, the old data is
implicitly loaded into a micro-architectural register.

This has implications for things like leakage aware stack-erasure.

## Method:

- Take a `DLEN` array of words called `zeros`, which is always zero.
- Take a `DLEN` array of words called `din`.
- Take a pair of input vairables:
  - `idx1` - Index of the arrays to load first.
  - `idx2` - Index of the arrays to load second.
- For each pair of values of `idx1` and `idx2`:
  - Zero the content of `din`.
  - **Store** zero to the addresses `din[idx1]` and `din[idx2]` to clear
    the store data path as best we can.
  - **Store** TTest variable 1 to the word at `din[idx1]`.
    - This may load the old data at `din[idx1]` into a micro-architectural
      register.
  - Execute a simple ALU instruction (`xor`) on a temporary register
    which does not store any TTest variables.
    This is assumed to clear pipeline registers which the load
    instructions might use.
  - **Store** TTest variable 2 to the word at `din[idx1]`.
    - Potentially overwriting the micro-architectural registers with
      the original data being overwritten by the store.
- Each step is separated in time by some NOP instructions to make the
  results easier to interpret.

@note The assumption that the ALU instruction clears pipeline registers
    is not a realistic one for super-scalar micro-architectures.
    It is more reasonable for scalar, in-order micro-architectures of the
    kind which are most realistically subject to power side-channel attack.

## Expectations:

- If store instructions implicitly load the *old* data at the address
  they are storing to into a micro-architectural registers, then
  we should see hamming distance leakage between consecutivley over-written
  values, even if we are over-writing the memory locations with zeros.

## Running the experiment

To run all stages of the experiment for a particular target device:

```
make -B USB_PORT=[PORT] UAS_TARGET=[TARGET] flow-memory-bus-registers-implicit-st-st-2
```

Where:
- `[PORT]` Is the UART/Serial port to communicate with it over.
- `[TARGET]` Is one of the target names listed in @ref targets

This will run all of the build, program, capture and analyse steps for
the experiment on the specified target.

The individual steps of the experiment are run with the following commands:

- Build: `make build_[TARGET]_memory-bus-registers-implicit-st-st-2`
- Program: `make program_[TARGET]_memory-bus-registers-implicit-st-st-2`
- Capture: `make capture_[TARGET]_memory-bus-registers-implicit-st-st-2 USB_PORT=[PORT]`
- Analyse: `make analyse_[TARGET]_memory-bus-registers-implicit-st-st-2`
